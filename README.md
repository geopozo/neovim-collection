# Neovim-Collection

This relies on uv. It opens up a temporary script and integrates those
dependencies with your project. It opens an ipython terminal for you.

`PyIt`

Open ipython terminal for a current script you have open.

`PyTemp`

Open a new tab w/ a blank script file and a ipython terminal.

I'm using lazyvim, I just add this repo to the plugins spec and all get loaded.

# ROADMAP

See issues on github.
